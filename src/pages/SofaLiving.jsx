          The living room, being the heart of the home, demands furniture that
          not only looks appealing but also offers comfort and functionality.

        <p className="suit-head">1. Understand Your Space</p>
        <p className="home-setting">
          Before diving into styles and designs, it's essential to understand
          the dimensions and layout of your living room. Measure your space
          meticulously to determine the size of the sofa set that will fit
          comfortably without overwhelming the room. Consider the placement of
          doors, windows, and other furniture to ensure the sofa complements the
          flow of the room. This will help you decide on the size of the sofa
          set that will best fit your space without overcrowding it.
